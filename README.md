# Names are hard...

Hi, I'm Ben.

But am I?

No, I'm actually Benjamin Haddleton.

But am I?

Well, on my driving licence, I'm Benjamin M Haddleton.

But am I?

Actually, I'm Benjamin M G Haddleton.

Well, full name would actually be Benjamin Matthew George Haddleton

But am I?

Oh, yeah. Mr Benjamin Matthew George Haddleton.

OK, I'm done.

Mine is one of the simpler names in the world, to be fair. Yes, telemarketers may say my last name in all the ways under the sun (and still never getting it right) and I may have to sacrifice an initial to some deity for my driving licence, but other than that, this isn't bad.

I read a post on Hacker News the other day [about someones name causing an issue with a booking](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21490850) (and then went down a rabbit hole of articles and videos, including one on Myanmar, where many people only have one name) and it got me thinking... Names are *hard*. Like, *really hard*. It's something that many devs wouldn't even think about. Create a form. First Name, Last Name, maybe a middle initial and a dropdown with Mr/Mrs/Miss to select from.

What if someone has a different name structure?

What about if we have constraints on character length for display reasons?

What about Gender Pronouns?

What about people who identify to a different name than their legal first name?

What if you're Cher? ðŸ˜Š

With this library, I'm hoping to alleviate some of the issues and maybe help developers be a bit more understanding of the fact that...
